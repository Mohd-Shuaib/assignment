Homepage Banner Slider:

1.  Open Customize Setting and navigate to the "Slideshow" section.
2.  Add three slides inside this section.
3.  For each slide, insert the content image and choose the country code (mandatory for data display).
4.  Ensure that a country code is selected; otherwise, data won't be displayed.
5.  Maintain default design options; do not alter settings for heading size or content position.
6.  Utilize a VPN extension to test functionality across different geographical locations.
7.  After VPN usage, verify the new preview link compatibility with the current theme.


Product Slider:


1.  Access Customize setting and integrate the "Featured Collection" section.
2.  Populate basic content (heading, description) and select the collection.
3.  Configure additional features such as default product display count (set to 8), and desktop column count.
4.  Enable "View all" checkbox if the collection exceeds the displayed product limit.
5.  Ensure carousel functionality is active for desktop.
6.  Adjust padding as necessary for section alignment.
7.  Implement BUCKS Currency Converter PRO++ app for currency conversion based on the customer's location.
8.  Validate functionality using VPN extension and confirm compatibility with the theme.



Image Block Section:


1.  Open Customize setting and locate the "Image Block" section.
2.  Add a title and choose the desired column layout.
3.  Populate multiple blocks within this section.
4.  For each block, insert an image, title, description, and select the country code.
5.  Country code selection is mandatory for data display.


Additional Notes:
•   Utilized Shopify API for displaying region-specific data.
•   Implemented BUCKS Currency Converter PRO++ app for dynamic currency conversion.
•   Instead of altering the product slider to include a country code select box, I only adjusted the currency. However, we can easily implement the same method used for the both section if necessary.
